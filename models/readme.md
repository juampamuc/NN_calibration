# Weights of Models
- The weights of models from last epoch using training procedures and models from [scripts](https://github.com/markus93/NN_calibration/tree/master/scripts) folder. The weights are trained using Keras with Tensorflow backend.
- The abbreviated names of models and datasets are followed by the number of convolutional layers in them.

## Abbreviations
- c10 = CIFAR-10
- c100 = CIFAR-100
- imgnet = ImageNet (ILSVRC2012)
- cars = Stanford Cars
- birds = Caltech-UCSD Birds 200
